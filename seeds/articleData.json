        "content": "Chlorophyll: The Molecule that Powers Life  Chlorophyll is one of the most important molecules on Earth. It's the molecule that makes life possible by converting sunlight into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Without chlorophyll, plants would not be able to produce the food they need to survive, and life as we know it would cease to exist. Here's what you need to know about this remarkable molecule.  What is Chlorophyll?  Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. It's responsible for capturing light energy from the sun and converting it into chemical energy that can be used by the plant. Chlorophyll is made up of a complex organic molecule called a porphyrin ring, which is surrounded by a long hydrocarbon tail.  How Does Chlorophyll Work?  Chlorophyll works by absorbing light energy from the sun and using it to power the process of photosynthesis. ",

        "content": "More than 2,000 women are taking the Swiss government to court claiming its policy on climate change is violating their right to life and health. The case is the first time the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) will hear a case on the impact of climate change on human rights. It follows six years of unsuccessful battles through the Swiss courts. Temperatures in Switzerland are rising faster than the global average and there are ever more frequent heatwaves. The Swiss women - who call themselves the Club of Climate Seniors and have an average age of 73 - say climate change is putting their human rights, their health and even their lives at risk. Their evidence to the court includes their medical records. They want the ECHR to order Switzerland to work harder at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the campaigners, Elisabeth Stern, told the BBC: Due to climate change, we have more heatwaves and older women suffer more. They die more often during these heatwaves than they otherwise would. Some people say, why are you complaining, you're going to die anyway. But we don't want to die just because our Swiss government has not been successful in coming up with a decent climate policy. The European Climate and Health Observatory says that projected increases in average temperature are likely to have serious impacts on public health across Europe, particularly among elderly people.",
